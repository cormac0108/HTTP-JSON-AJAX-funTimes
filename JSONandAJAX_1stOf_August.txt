everytime we make a requet - we dont want to be reloading the page / refreshing the page. 
its slow. For a nice UI. AJAX solves this reload problem.   update a web page without reloading
the page. 
the new way to gt data is called.   Fetch  ..  
fetch('my/url').then(response => {
    console.log(response);
});
page updates arre alot quicker. AJAX is everywhere. parts load dynamically. 
window.fetch    fetch is a part of the window object.  fetch comes with its own method called 
.json()   .then(response => response.json())
JSON view chrome extension. to make looking at json prettier. 
fetch API   --- promise  promises to let you know when it has this value returned (
    from its request over the internet. 
)
access the data in the object you fetched?   so do another .then  to get to the data.
